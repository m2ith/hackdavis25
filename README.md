# HackDavis 2025

## Inspiration
Two projects we drew inspiration from were [Spent](https://playspent.org/) and [Pierrick Calvez’s A Five-Minute Guide to Better Typography](https://www.pierrickcalvez.com/journal/a-five-minute-guide-to-better-typography). In the ideation stage, we went back and forth on what topic to tackle and decided to talk about an often stigmatized struggle – food insecurity. Food insecurity is something many people have lived in proximity of, whether they have experienced the effects firsthand, known people who navigate the strain it causes, or otherwise have heard the stories of people who do, but it is still something people feel they should grapple with silently.

## Goals
The goal of Savoir is to breach the silence and bring real facts to people’s attention through a bright, informative lens while not avoiding the true, difficult realities people undergo.

## Research
Melody conducted the research, finding insights on impacts to health as well as food insecurity by demographics. Two peer reviewed articles and one web article from the USDA were used. See her research in more detail at [this link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZhZMdNhRKR7Xrcx6xAJ2dwkp_3gJ3qvIxtb28fKr6CQ/edit?tab=t.0)!

## What It Does
Guides the viewer through an information-focused visual experience about food insecurity. Introduces facts in memorable ways through engaging visuals and statistics. Brings resources to the viewer’s attention – not only ways to help others, but to help themselves, too.

## How We Built It
Melody researched and wrote content. Meredith coded the website into reality with HTML, CSS, and JS. Lauren and Alexis crafted the visual identity of the project.

## Challenges We Ran Into
Technical challenges in the code? Deciding what information to include. While there was a lot of information that could have been included, there was a strong need to edit things down enough so people would understand what they were reading while also wanting to continue reading. We needed a lot of visuals and assets.

## Accomplishments That We're Proud Of
Overall, we're all very proud of what we've contributed and successfully collaborated to make this learning experience. We're proud of the visuals that we created to represent our research. Also, it was a great process to bring everyone's skills and use of programs together to make a cohesive project.

## What We Learned
We quickly learned about the importance of research and how it acts as guidance for the educational information that outlines the project. With the research, it serves as a framework for the experience and how a user moves through the learning journey. Also, it was rewarding to learn how beneficial it is to have multiple skills coming from different teammates and providing those new perspectives.
